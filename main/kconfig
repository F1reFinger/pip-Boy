# --- Rotary Encoder Switch (Button) ---
config PIN_ENCODER_SW
    int "GPIO number for Encoder Switch (SW)"
    range 0 39
    default 34
    help
        The GPIO pin connected to the push button (switch) contact of the rotary encoder.
        This pin is typically configured with an interrupt on the falling edge (press).

# --- Rotary Encoder Phase A ---
config PIN_ENCODER_A
    int "GPIO number for Encoder Phase A"
    range 0 39
    default 35
    help
        The GPIO pin connected to the Phase A output of the rotary encoder.
        This pin is used for directional detection in the ISR.

# --- Rotary Encoder Phase B ---
config PIN_ENCODER_B
    int "GPIO number for Encoder Phase B (DT)"
    range 0 39
    default 36
    help
        The GPIO pin connected to the Phase B (or DT/Data) output of the rotary encoder.
        This pin is used in conjunction with Phase A for directional detection.
